    "On _Introduction to stochastic processes_ (Lawler), optimal stopping problems are described in a very general framework. Each roll has a payoff equal to $f(k)$, where $k$ is the roll, and $f$ a generic payoff function. At the same time, the player has a value function that associates to each roll $k$ a value given by following the optimal strategy, $v(k)$. There exists also an expected value $u(k)$ that is the expected value of $v$ at the next roll, so that $u(k)=\\sum_k \\mathbb E[v(k)|k]\\mathbb P(k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy reads in the following way: if $f(k)$ is larger than $u(k)$, the player should stop rolling, because the immediate gain is larger than the expected value under optimal conditions. Clearly, $v(k)=\\max[f(k), u(k)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think that the system is a Markov chain, then there exists a transition matrix $P=\\{P_{ij}=\\mathbb P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i)\\}$, and $u(k)=P v(k)=\\sum_{j=1}^n P_{kj}v(j)$. So $v(k)=\\max[f(k), Pv(k)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a cost $g(k)$ is included, one gets $v(k)=\\max[f(k), Pv(k) - g(k)]$.\n",

    "$$ v_{n+1}(k) = \\max[f(k), Pv_{n-1}(k) - g(k)].$$\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "1. $P$ is going to be a full matrix, with every element equal to $1/d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the dice, because it is the transition matrix of a Markov chain that can reach any state from any state with the same probability\n",
    "2. $f(k)=k$\n",
    "3. $g(k)=1$, because rolling always costs 1\n",
